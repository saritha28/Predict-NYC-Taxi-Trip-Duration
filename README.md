# Predict-NYC-Taxi-Trip-Duration

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the duration of taxi trips in New York City using various machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest. The goal is to estimate trip durations based on features like pickup/dropoff locations, time of day, and other relevant attributes.

## Data Description
The dataset comprises records of taxi trips in NYC, including pickup/dropoff timestamps, locations, and trip durations. It serves as the basis for training and testing predictive models.

## Data Preprocessing
- Missing values are handled, and data inconsistencies are addressed.
- Outliers and anomalies in the data are identified and processed.

## Feature Engineering
- Relevant features are extracted or engineered from the available data, such as distance, time of day, day of the week, and traffic conditions.

## Modeling
Four machine learning algorithms are utilized for prediction:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Gradient Boosting
- Random Forest

Each model is trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict trip durations based on the selected features.

## Model Evaluation
- Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared are computed for each model to assess prediction accuracy.
- Comparative analysis of the models' performance is provided to determine their effectiveness in predicting taxi trip durations.

## Usage
- The project facilitates estimating NYC taxi trip durations using different regression-based machine learning techniques.
- Modify hyperparameters or feature engineering steps to improve model performance.
- Use the models for real-time trip duration prediction or further experimentation.

Explore, modify, or extend the codebase according to specific requirements or additional analyses needed for your predictive models.
